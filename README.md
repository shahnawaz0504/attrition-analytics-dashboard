# attrition-analytics-dashboard

An interactive dashboard that explains the "Whys" of employee attrition from a company. KPIs like Attrition Rate, Employee Age, Employee Salary and Working Years at Company are added to the dashboard.<br><br>

Initially, the KPIs are added to the dashboard. Then, I have made a **donut chart** to understand if the attrition is related to the *EducationField* of the employee. Later, I made a **stacked bar chart** to see attritions according to the job roles (I have chosen top 4 job roles).<br><br>

I have made a **table** of *Job Roles* where count of attrition is explained by the feature *JobSatisfaction* (which is a numeric rating between 1-4). Further, I have created another **stacked bar chart** that explains attrition with respect to *SalarySlabs*. There's a **stacked area chart** for better understanding about employee attrition through the years of working done at the present company. Then, a **stacked column chart** helps us to understand if attrition is related to a specific age group, which explains that there's actually a high rate of attrition in the age group of [26-35].<br><br>

Eventually, I have added a **slicer/filter** on the basis of *Department* of the employee. And, a **treemap** for segregating the attrited employees on the basis of *Gender*.
