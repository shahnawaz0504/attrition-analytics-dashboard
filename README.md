# attrition-analytics-dashboard

An interactive dashboard that explains the "Whys" of employee attrition from a company. KPIs like Attrition Rate, Employee Age, Employee Salary and Working Years at Company are added to the dashboard.<br><br>

Initially, the KPIs are added to the dashboard. Then, I have made a donut chart to understand if the attrition is related to the *education field* of the employee. Later, I made a stacked bar chart to see attritions according to the salary slabs (I have chosen top 4 job roles).
